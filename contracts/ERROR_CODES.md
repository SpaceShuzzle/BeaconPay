# Unified Error Codes

This document audits and documents all error codes across the BeaconPay smart contract
monorepo. Error codes are assigned non-colliding ranges per contract to avoid
ambiguity when errors propagate across contract boundaries.

| manage_hub        | 1000–1999 | MH-    |
| access_control    | 2000–2999 | AC-    |
| membership_token  | 3000–3999 | MT-    |
| workspace_booking | 4000–4999 | WB-    |

## Collision Analysis

### Previous Collision (RESOLVED)

The following error names were shared across contracts with different numeric codes:

| Name                | manage_hub | access_control              | membership_token | workspace_booking | payment_escrow | resource_credits |
| ------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| AdminNotSet         | 1          | 101 (as AdminRequired)      | 1                | 1                 | 1              | 1                |
| Unauthorized        | 4          | 100                         | —                | 2                 | 2              | 3                |
| AlreadyInitialized  | —          | 110 (as ConfigurationError) | —                | 3                 | 3              | 2                |
| InsufficientBalance | 14         | —                           | —                | 107               | —              | 4                |

**After unification**: Each contract now uses its own range, eliminating all collisions.
When an error is caught cross-contract, the range prefix immediately identifies
the originating contract.

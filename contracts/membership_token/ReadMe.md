# Membership Token Contract

A Soroban (Stellar) smart contract for issuing, transferring, and querying time-bound membership tokens in the BeaconPay ecosystem.

## Overview

Each membership token is identified by a unique 32-byte ID and has:

- **Owner** – the address that currently holds the token.
- **Status** – `Active` or `Expired`.
- **Issue date** – timestamp when the token was minted.
- **Expiry date** – timestamp after which the token is no longer valid.

## Functions

| Function                             | Auth          | Description                                                    |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `set_admin(admin)`                   | `admin`       | Set or replace the contract administrator.                     |
| `issue_token(id, user, expiry_date)` | admin         | Mint a new membership token.                                   |
| `transfer_token(id, new_user)`       | current owner | Transfer token ownership.                                      |
| `get_token(id)`                      | none          | Retrieve token details; returns `TokenExpired` if past expiry. |

## Binary Target

`src/bin/membership-token.rs` is a **placeholder binary** used solely for contract deployment tooling. It prints the contract name and exits. It is not used at runtime on-chain.

## Error Codes

| Code | Name                 | Meaning                                             |
| ---- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | `AdminNotSet`        | No admin has been configured yet.                   |
| 2    | `TokenAlreadyIssued` | A token with this ID already exists.                |
| 3    | `InvalidExpiryDate`  | Expiry date must be in the future.                  |
| 4    | `TokenNotFound`      | No token with the given ID exists.                  |
| 5    | `TokenExpired`       | Token has expired or an inactive token was queried. |

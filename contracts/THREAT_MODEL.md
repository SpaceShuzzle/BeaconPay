## 1. manage_hub (Monolith)

| Vector                     | Description                                                   | Mitigation                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unauthorized admin change  | Attacker calls `set_admin` directly                           | `require_auth()` on admin; multisig integration via access_control   |
| Front-running pause toggle | Frontrunner submits `set_pause_config` ahead of legitimate tx | Time-locked operations documented; consider commit-reveal pattern    |
| Integer overflow           | Overflow in subscription/pricing arithmetic                   | `overflow-checks = true` in release profile; checked arithmetic used |
| Denial of service          | Unbounded loops in storage iteration                          | Pagination via `Vec` with bounded page sizes                         |
| Reentrancy                 | Callback during cross-contract calls                          | Soroban VM prevents cross-contract reentrancy by design              |

## 2. access_control

| Vector                     | Description                              | Mitigation                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Privilege escalation       | Non-admin calling `set_role`             | `is_admin` guard checked before mutation                              |
| Proposal replay            | Re-executing expired multisig proposals  | `ProposalType::Expiry` field checked; proposals expire after deadline |
| Role enumeration DoS       | Enumerate all roles to exhaust resources | Roles stored per-address, not enumerable                              |
| Unauthorized proposal vote | Non-member voting on a proposal          | `MembershipInfo` checked before vote is accepted                      |

## 3. membership_token

| Vector                | Description                 | Mitigation                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Double mint           | Minting same token twice    | Token ID uniqueness enforced by storage key  |
| Unauthorized transfer | Transfer without owner auth | `require_auth()` on sender                   |
| Overflow in supply    | Minting past `u128::MAX`    | Checked arithmetic; `overflow-checks = true` |

## 4. workspace_booking

| Vector                   | Description                                   | Mitigation                                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Double-booking           | Two users booking same slot                   | Atomic check-and-set in persistent storage             |
| Front-running bookings   | Frontrunner sees booking tx and submits first | Consider commit-reveal for high-contention bookings    |
| DoS via phantom bookings | Reserve slots without paying                  | Payment confirmation required before booking finalised |

## 5. payment_escrow

| Vector                | Description                                | Mitigation                                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reentrancy on release | Re-entering escrow during release callback | Soroban VM prevents cross-contract reentrancy                    |
| Stuck funds           | No release/refund path                     | Both `release` and `refund` paths implemented with admin/timeout |
| Integer overflow      | Overflow on fee calculation                | Checked arithmetic; overflow-checks profile flag                 |

## 6. resource_credits

| Vector                | Description                                     | Mitigation                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unbounded expiry scan | Iterating all members to expire credits         | `expire_credits` operates per-member; `get_expiring_credits` requires explicit member list    |
| Supply drift          | Balance sum diverges from total_supply          | `reconcile_credits` provides audit function; new in SC-25                                     |
| Credit expiry bypass  | Member avoids expiry by transferring before TTL | Expiry is tracked per-mint; transferred credits still carry original expiry via Credit record |
| Unauthorised mint     | Minting without admin role                      | `caller == admin` check + `require_auth()`                                                    |

## General Mitigations (All Contracts)

- **No `std`**: All contracts compile with `#![no_std]` to reduce attack surface.
- **Overflow checks**: Release profile sets `overflow-checks = true`.
- **LTO + strip**: Release binary is stripped of symbols and link-time optimized to minimise bloat.
- **Soroban VM sandbox**: Cross-contract calls are sandboxed; no arbitrary memory access.
- **Auth guards**: Every state-changing function requires `require_auth()` from the relevant authority.

## Recommended Additional Mitigations

1. **Commit-reveal for booking and proposals** – prevents front-running.
2. **Rate limiting on `expire_credits`** – bound gas per invocation.
3. **Per-address credit expiry tracking** – avoid scanning the full member set.
4. **Formal verification** – consider Certora or similar for payment_escrow invariants.
5. **Audit of `reconcile_credits`** – ensure Vec member list cannot be manipulated to hide discrepancies.
